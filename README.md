# DevOps Git Project – Task 4

## Objective
This project demonstrates version control and Git best practices in a DevOps workflow.  
The goal is to manage code changes efficiently using branches, pull requests, and proper documentation.

## Branch Structure
- **main** → Stable, production-ready branch  
- **dev** → Development/testing branch  
- **feature1** → Feature branch for new changes

## Files in Project
- **.gitignore** → To ignore unnecessary files (e.g., logs, cache, node_modules)  
- **README.md** → Project overview and documentation  
- **TASKS.md** → Step-by-step documentation of tasks completed

## Workflow Followed
1. Initialized GitHub repository  
2. Created branches: main, dev, feature1  
3. Added `.gitignore` to exclude unwanted files  
4. Added `README.md` and `TASKS.md`  
5. Pushed feature branch to GitHub  
6. Opened Pull Request (feature1 → dev) and merged  
7. Merged dev → main  
8. Optional: Created tag `v1.0`

## Outcome
- Practiced Git branching, commits, and pull requests  
- Learned to document tasks using Markdown  
- Implemented a version-controlled DevOps workflow  

## Notes
- All changes follow Git best practices  
- Pull Requests were used to merge branches, ensuring safe and controlled updates
